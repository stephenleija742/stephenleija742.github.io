            <p>On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and
               dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of
               pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot
               foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal
               blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of
               will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and
               pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish.
               In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when
               nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every
               pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain
               circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations
               of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be
               repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always
               holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects
               pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures
               pains to avoid worse pains.</p>
